#### This is a fork from [AspNetCore-CustomLoggingProvider](https://github.com/tbebekis/AspNetCore-CustomLoggingProvider)<br> *I like it and I try to refactor and add some new providers to it.*
#### reading this code is so helpful to know how built-in aspnetcore logging system is working<br> also, thanks again to [Theodoros Bebekis](https://teonotebook.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/how-to-write-a-custom-logging-provider-in-asp-net-core/) for publish a good and full tutorial about this topic.
